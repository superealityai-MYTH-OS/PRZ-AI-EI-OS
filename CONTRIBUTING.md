# Contributing to PRZ AI/EI/OS 🌀

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Post-Reality Zone Operating System! It is the collective resonance of contributors like you that moves this project from Vapor to Crystal.

## 🏛 The Seven Pillars Compliance
All contributions must align with the Seven Pillars framework. If you are adding a new module or feature, ensure it:
1. **Reduces Chatter Friction**: Does it help the agent move faster with less redundant interaction?
2. **Maintains Resonance**: Does it provide clear validation for user intent?
3. **Is Modular**: Can it be plugged into the `PRZ Pipeline`?

## 🚀 How Can I Contribute?

### 1. ZAK Echo Registry
The most impactful way to contribute is by adding new **ZAK Echoes** to `lib/zak-echoes.ts`. A ZAK Echo is a pre-validated pattern for a specific task (e.g., "React Component Refactoring", "Security Audit", "API Documentation").

### 2. Core Engine Improvements
We are always looking for better math and logic for:
- **Resonance Engine**: Improving the vector similarity logic.
- **Harmonic Field**: Enhancing complex intent matching.
- **GOOSEGUARD**: Better loop detection patterns.

### 3. Documentation & Manifestos
Help us refine the PRZ philosophy. If you can explain the concepts of "Vapor" and "Crystal" more clearly, we want your PR!

## 🛠 Development Workflow
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-echo`.
3. **Commit** your changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing ZAK Echo'`.
4. **Push** to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-echo`.
5. **Open a Pull Request**.

## ⚖️ Code of Conduct
We operate in the **Green Lane**. Be respectful, be conductive, and help others find their flow.
